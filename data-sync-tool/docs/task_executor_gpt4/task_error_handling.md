# Task Error Handling


I understand that you are considering a variety of potential failure scenarios, which is important in ensuring a robust and fault-tolerant system. Let's break down each of these potential issues:

1. **Network error**: These are usually temporary and can be solved by implementing retries with exponential backoff. Essentially, this means that if a task fails due to a network error, you can try to execute it again after a certain period of time. If it fails again, you wait for a longer period of time before trying again, and so on.
2. **Rate limit exceeded**: When the rate limit is exceeded, it usually means that too many requests have been sent in a given time period. To handle this, we need to have a mechanism to back off when this limit is exceeded. This can be implemented as part of the rate limiter that you have in your design.
3. **Invalid request**: This usually indicates a bug or a problem in the task. It is generally not possible to recover from such issues automatically, and they need to be logged for debugging.
4. **User sends a control c signal**: This can be handled by listening to system signals in your application and reacting accordingly. For example, you could add a shutdown hook to the application that will gracefully shut down the execution when it receives a control c signal.
5. **User cancels the task**: This could be handled by having a mechanism to mark tasks as cancelled. The task executor can then check the status of a task before executing it.
6. **Other unrecoverable error**: These errors are generally hard to predict, and the best course of action usually depends on the specific situation. A common approach is to log the error and stop the task execution.

Let's update your `SyncTaskExecutor` accordingly:

```rust
struct SyncTaskExecutor {
    tasks: VecDeque<SyncTask>,
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    rate_limiters: HashMap<DatasetId, RateLimiter>,
    task_status: HashMap<TaskId, TaskStatus>,
}

enum TaskStatus {
    Running,
    Failed(Error),
    Cancelled,
}

impl SyncTaskExecutor {
    fn new(tasks: Vec<SyncTask>, workers: Vec<Worker>) -> Self { ... }

    async fn run(&mut self) {
        while let Some(task) = self.tasks.pop_front() {
            if self.is_cancelled(&task) {
                continue;
            }

            match self.execute_task(task).await {
                Ok(_) => (),
                Err(e) => {
                    if is_network_error(&e) {
                        self.retry_task(task);
                    } else if is_rate_limit_exceeded(&e) {
                        self.rate_limiters.get_mut(&task.dataset_id).unwrap().freeze();
                        self.retry_task(task);
                    } else if is_invalid_request(&e) {
                        self.mark_as_failed(task, e);
                    } else {
                        // Unrecoverable error
                        self.mark_as_failed(task, e);
                        break;
                    }
                },
            }
        }
    }

    async fn execute_task(&self, task: SyncTask) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let worker = self.select_worker();
        worker.handle(task).await
    }

    fn select_worker(&self) -> &Worker { ... }

    fn retry_task(&mut self, task: SyncTask) { ... }

    fn is_cancelled(&self, task: &SyncTask) -> bool {
        matches!(self.task_status.get(&task.id), Some(TaskStatus::Cancelled))
    }

    fn mark_as_failed(&mut self, task: SyncTask, error: Error) {
        self.task_status.insert(task.id, TaskStatus::Failed(error));
    }
}
```

Please note that this design is quite simple and may not cover all your requirements
